This is my Slack test project.

I made a simple service to request the data for the photos. It includes stubs for other possible apis that could
be contacted by the service. There are also a few basic tests to make sure things are working.

The app starts on page load and requests photos from a specific flickr group photo pool. It takes the first 50 and
puts them on the page. This could be expanded to include pages of photos or dynamic loading of new photos when scrolling
to the bottom of the page.

The light box opens when a photo is clicked and provides buttons to move to the previous and next images in the list.
I only put basic styling for the light box. I could have done better transitions when moving from previous to next.
close the light box you need to click the X in the top right. I didn't make it close when clicking the opaque in case
a user misses clicking the prev/next and closes it on accident.
